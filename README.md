# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Temperature Distribution in Cryosurgery

## Project Overview

This project uses a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to model and predict temperature distributions during cryosurgery procedures.

## Repository Structure

- **`PINN_solution_for_Temperature_Distribution_in_Cryosurgery.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for developing, experimenting with, and visualizing the PINN model.
- **`main.py`**: Command-line interface (CLI) for running the trained model easily.

## Getting Started

### Run on the Cloud (Recommended)

A ready-to-use cloud solution is available at `link`

### Run Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. (Optional) Open and modify `PINN_solution_for_Temperature_Distribution_in_Cryosurgery.ipynb` to experiment with the model.
4. Use the CLI by running:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
